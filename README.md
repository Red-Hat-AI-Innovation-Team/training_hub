# training_hub
An algorithm-focused interface for common llm training, continual learning, and reinforcement learning techniques.

## Support Matrix

Note: the below is currently an example metric, no algorithm interfaces have yet to be implemented

| Algorithm | PEFT | VERL | InstructLab-Training | (to be added) |
